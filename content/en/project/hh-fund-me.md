## About The Project

My Ethereum Crowd Funding project is full stack decentralized application built who's backend ([GH repo](https://github.com/larry-lime/fund-me-backend)) is built with Solidity and the Hardhat Ethereum development framework. Tests are done with Mocha & Chai in Javascript. Additionally, it utilizes Chainlink pricefeed oracles and its frontend ([GH repo](https://github.com/larry-lime/solidity-js-fcc)) is coded in vanilla HTML/CSS and Javascript. This project was created as a part of Patrick Collin's Solidity and Javascript smart contract course with Free Code Camp.
