# Workout Program

## Split Rationale

- 5 days a week
- "Normal workout split"
  - Push, Pull, Legs, Push, Pull, Legs
- Why I should not adhere to such a workout split:
  - I want to workout 5 days a week, with one day of cardio (soccer) on the weekends
  - I hardly need to work on legs. All I need to do is play soccer and squat a little on push days
  - I need to work mainly on my chest, delts, and traps
- Adjusted split:
  - Push, Pull, Push, Pull, Push
