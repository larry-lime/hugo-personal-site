5. To start a local server, in the VSCode terminal run:

   ```shell
   hugo server -D
   ```

   * Copy the web server address and open it in your browser
   * By default it is `localhost:1313`

## Creating Content

1. Run this command in the VScode Terminal

   ```shell
   hugo new about.md
   ```

   * Here you are creating a new [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) file that you can edit in VSCode or another code/markdown editor

2. Copy and paste the following markdown into your `about.md` after the front matter to get familiar with the basic syntax

   ```markdown
   # Heading 1
   ## Heading 2
   ### Heading 3
   #### Heading 4
   
   Normal Text
   
   *italic text*
   
   **bold text**
   
   ### Unordered List
   1. first
   2. second
   3. third
   
   ### Unordered List (bullets)
   - first
     - level 2
       - level 3
   - second
   - third
   
   ### Task list
   - [ ] Task 1
   - [ ] Task 2
   - [ ] Task 3
   
   ### Table
   | Column1    | Column2    | Column3    |
   |---------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
   | Item1.1    | Item2.1    | Item3.1    |
   | Item1.2    | Item2.2    | Item3.2    |
   ```

3. Creating a project

   ```shell
   hugo new projects/first-project.md
   ```
   
   * Here, you are creating a new folder called `projects` in your `content` folder.
   * Within the `projects` folder, you are creating a file called `first-project.md`
   * So now, the *Projects*

### Adding Images to Homepage

1. Create a new folder named `img` in the `static` folder in your website directory

2. Search and save as an image from the internet

3. Drag the image into your `img` folder

4. In your `config.yml`, edit the value of your `imageUrl` on line 29

   ```yaml
   params:
     profileMode:
       enabled: true
       title: "Your Name"
       subtitle: "ðŸ‘· Who you are | ðŸ’» Major Student | ðŸ“š NYU Shanghai"
       imageUrl: "img/your-image-name.jpeg" # <--- TODO: Edit This
       imageTitle: "Profile Picture"
       imageWidth: 200
       imageHeight: 200
       buttons:
         - name: Contact Me
           url: "/contact"
         - name: Github
           url: "https://github.com"
   ```

### Adding Images to Content

1. Save as a new image into your `static/img` directory using the steps listed above

2. Open `first-project.md`

3. Edit the front matter so that it looks like this

   ```yaml
   ---

   date: 2022-11-04T13:20:02+08:00
   draft: true
   cover:
       image: img/nyu_shanghai.jpeg
       alt: 'NYU Shanghai Qiantan Campus'
       caption: 'This is the caption'
   ---
   ```

   * You are editing the frontmatter to add a cover photo to your content

## Build and Deploy Your Website

2. Connect your local project with your remote repository

3. Git add, commit, and push to your remote repository

   ```shell

   git branch -M main
   ### You will want to copy the following part from github ###

   git push -u origin main
   ```
