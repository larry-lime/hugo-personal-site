## Build and Deploy Your Website

2. Connect your local project with your remote repository

3. Git add, commit, and push to your remote repository

   ```shell
   git add .
   git commit -m "first commit"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/your-account/uba-website-workshop.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```
