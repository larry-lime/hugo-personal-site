## Who am I?

Hi, I’m Lawrence Lim and I’m currently a Sophomore CS student based in Shanghai. I have experience in product development and research and currently focus my personal projects on smart contract development.
Besides programming, i'm often playing soccer, going to the gym, or organizing community events in Shanghai.

I’m also very passionate about open source and am always interested in hearing about opportunities in tech. Never hesitate to reach out or connect!
